# panopticon-tui

![CI](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/panopticon-tui/workflows/Rust%20CI/badge.svg)
![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/panopticon-tui.svg)

Terminal UI observability and diagnostic tool for Scala applications.

Currently supports:
- [ZIO-ZMX](https://github.com/zio/zio-zmx)
- [Slick + HikariCP](https://scala-slick.org/doc/3.2.0/config.html#monitoring) (over JMX)
- Akka actor metrics (via [akka-periscope](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/akka-periscope))

## Usage

### Prerequisites

You'll need to have java installed (it is loaded dynamically by [jmx](https://docs.rs/jmx/0.2.0/jmx/) crate).

### Example

There's a complete example of adjusting a real project to work with panopticon. [Check it out](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/panopticon-example) to see how it's done.

### Running Panopticon

To get a binary for your OS check [releases](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/panopticon-tui/releases) page.

Panopticon is published to [crates.id](https://crates.io/), so if you have rust toolchain installed, you can run `cargo install panopticon-tui` and it will build the executable for you.

You can also build it from sources:
```
cargo build
./target/debug/panopticon-tui [OPTIONS]
```

To get a detailed help message, run:
```
panopticon-tui --help
```

### ⚠️ MacOS and libjvm.dylib

On MacOS you can face an error like this:
```
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libjvm.dylib
  Referenced from: panopticon-tui
  Reason: image not found
```

It means that [j4rs](https://docs.rs/j4rs), which is used for JMX integration wasn't able to locate your java installation.

To fix that, just create a symlink to `libjvm.dylib` (this works for JDK 11 and MacOS 10.15.4):

```
sudo ln -s $(/usr/libexec/java_home)/lib/server/libjvm.dylib /usr/local/lib
```

Depending on your MacOS version or java package, location may differ, so make sure to check the symlink is valid.


### Connecting to zio-zmx server

[ZIO-ZMX](https://github.com/zio/zio-zmx) is a tool for monitoring ZIO-based apps. With panopticon you can see the fiber tree visualized and monitor their number:

![ZIO tab demo](./assets/zio-demo.png)

You can specify zio-zmx server address with `--zio-zmx` option. In this case Panopticon will connect to it and show a ZMX tab:
```
panopticon-tui --zio-zmx localhost:6789
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Currently, zio-zmx doesn't provide efficient ways of getting fiber count metrics, so Panopticon has to do a full fiber dump each tick to calculate them. Make sure your `tick-rate` isn't too frequent.

### Database metrics over JMX

Panopticon can show database metrics, if your app exposes them via JMX. Slick and HikariCP are the only supported options at the moment.

![Slick tab demo](./assets/slick-demo.png)

Slick tab will be shown in Panopticon if you specify these two options:

```
panopticon-tui --jmx localhost:9010 --db-pool-name myDb
```

Here `db-pool-name` is a connection pool name, used to qualify JMX beans for Slick and/or HikariCP. 

See [this section](https://scala-slick.org/doc/3.2.0/config.html#monitoring) of Slick docs for details about setting up your app to expose db metrics over JMX.

Also keep in mind that you need to specify some JVM parameters on startup so that your app exposes JMX metrics. Something along the following lines:

```
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.port=9010
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=9010
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.local.only=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false
-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false
```

### Akka metrics

Panopticon can also display an entire tree of actors under some actor system. As well as monitor total amount of actors in time.

![Slick tab demo](./assets/akka-demo.png)

To use this feature, however, you'd have to enable publication of this data in your application. There's the [akka-periscope](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/akka-periscope) library, specifically suited for that purpose. Checkout it's README for the detauls on how you can set it up.

Only HTTP way of transfer is supported for at the moment. To use it and see the actor data on a separate tab, launch Panopticon with following options:

```
panopticon-tui --actor-tree http://localhost:8080/actor-tree --actor-count http://localhost:8080/actor-count
```

Replace the endpoint urls with the ones you set up with [akka-periscope](https://github.com/ScalaConsultants/akka-periscope).

## Build from sources
